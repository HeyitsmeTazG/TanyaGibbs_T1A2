# COMPUTERS AGAINST DEVELOPERS

### A terminal app

**Computers against Developers** is a terminal app inspired by the game "Cards against Humanity". This is built using Ruby to explore object-oriented programming, as well as modularisation and DRY scripting principles.

In this version, the user plays against the computer in order to try and win the game, by accumulating the most points against the other computer 'players'.

##### Description

To start the game: **Insert how this is done**

The computer is the **Card Master**, who deals out the answer-cards to the players, and also asks draws a question card at the beginning of each round for the players to answer.

The Card Master then shuffles the answers given in the round, and the answer cards are presented to the screen, so that we can read the combinations.

The Card Master then randomly selects an answer card, and the player that submitted it wins the round and gains a point.

This repeats until there are no more cards to play.

##### Motivation and Other Ideas

For this assignment, I wanted to be creative, and also build something that I would enjoy playing and sharing with other people.

Board and card games have always been a hobby of mine, so I decided to re-create one of my favourite games, but make it applicable to the struggles we have as developers.

Other project ideas I explored were:

- A **horror game** that tries to determine whether the user is Human, or AI based on a series of questions, which are triggered by the answer the user inputs.

Though I would still like to build something like this, I decided against this idea for now, as there weren't many features accessible to the user other than just inputting answers.

When I thought about other potential features I could add, this made me realise that building this is out of my scope at this stage in my learning.

- A **Uni timetable app** that allows students to schedule their classes, coursework and assignments that they have to complete.

This is another project I am still very interested in building, though again, the logistics are out of my scope for now.

I also feel as though this project would be better executed through other programming languages where I could add stylesheets to make the UI more intuitive and accessible.
