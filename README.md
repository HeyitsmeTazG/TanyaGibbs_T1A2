# COMPUTERS AGAINST DEVELOPERS

### Outline

**Computers against Developers** is a terminal app inspired by the game "Cards against Humanity". This is built using Ruby to explore object-oriented programming, as well as modularisation and DRY scripting principles.

In this version, the user plays against the computer in order to try and win the game, by accumulating the most points against the other computer 'players'.

##### Description

To start the game: **Insert how this is done**

The computer is the **Card Master**, who deals out the answer-cards to the players, and also asks draws a question card at the beginning of each round for the players to answer.

The Card Master then shuffles the answers given in the round, and the answer cards are presented to the screen, so that we can read the combinations.

The Card Master then randomly selects an answer card, and the player that submitted it wins the round and gains a point.

This repeats until there are no more cards to play.

##### Motivation and Other Ideas

For this assignment, I wanted to be creative, and also build something that I would enjoy playing and sharing with other people.

Board and card games have always been a hobby of mine, so I decided to re-create one of my favourite games, but make it applicable to the struggles we have as developers.

**Other project ideas I explored were:**

- A **horror game** that tries to determine whether the user is Human, or AI based on a series of questions, which are triggered by the answer the user inputs.

Though I would still like to build something like this, I decided against this idea for now, as there weren't many features accessible to the user other than just inputting answers.

When I thought about other potential features I could add, this made me realise that building this is out of my scope at this stage in my learning.

- A **Uni timetable app** that allows students to schedule their classes, coursework and assignments that they have to complete.

This is another project I am still very interested in building, though again, the logistics are out of my scope for now.

I also feel as though this project would be better executed through other programming languages where I could add stylesheets to make the UI more intuitive and accessible.

# Software Development Plan

### R5 Purpose & Scope

### R6 Features

**Current**

- Display menu, and allow selection using user input to choose an option (Start game, view high scores, read rules)
- Randomly generate cards pulled from an array to distribute among players
- view cards in hand (as player)
- select card using user input to submit card for round
- view all answer combinations from answers provided for round from each (human and computer) player
- generate a winner of the round
- allocate a point to the winner of the round
- run loops until all the answer cards in players hands are finished
- calculate winner of game

**Possible**

- link multiple terminals together
- allow players to rotate between being Question Master and Human player
- Allow Question Master to manually select favourite answer card
- re-fill players hand back up to minimum amount of cards until there are no cards left in answer card deck
